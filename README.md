# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
# daily-task-planner

## Description

This project is a simply calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This app uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Instructions
```md
To use the daily planner and create a schedule.
Open the planner website and the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
If you scroll down you can use the timeblocks for standard business hours.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
If you click into a timeblock you can enter an event.
Click the save button for that timeblock and text for that event is saved in local storage.
If you refresh the page the saved events persist.
```
